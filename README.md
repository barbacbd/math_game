# MathGame

# This project was developed for personal/academic use with a partner (Ryan Wolter). All of our
# old project files have been added to the project at this time since it was not a git project
# when it was created. The game was programmed in complete C code. It has been years since it was
# originally written in 2014, and it could use a severe cleanup as of late 2018. 

# The project will allow users to login to the game. Each round a new mathematical question will
# be asked and each user should answer. Based on when you enter the round it is possible for 
# you to answer a question faster than all other users and receive extra points.
