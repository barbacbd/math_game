# Mathematical Test Game

The server/client game allows users to login in to a simple database. Once a game has begun, a new
question will be asked ever x seconds. The first person to answer the question correctly will receive
a bonus amount of points. Your round begins as soon as you enter the round, so it is possible for
someone who has logged in late to still receive the most points per round. 

> Originally developed for personal & academic use with a partner (Ryan Wolter) in 2014.
